# Repository Rules

This repository works as follows.

__Master <- Feature Branch__

Feature stories are generated by business needs and branches are created based on those features. Those features are
tested on their respective branches before being merged into master. All feature branch pull requests are subjected to review
prior to merging code into master.



# Local Build Requirements

`IDE (Intellij CE)`
`Java 11.0.3 or higher`
`Groovy 2.6 or higher`
`Gradle 5.x or higher`



# To Build / Run Locally

First `git clone <repo cloning url>` to a directory on your machine. Then Import project into IDE , `Intellij` works
well with `Gradle`. Let the project build. Once the project is done building open the terminal in the IDE (If you open
a terminal outside the IDE its fine, just remember to switch to the project directory) and type `gradle bootRun` if on
`Windows`, `./gradlew bootRun` if on `Linux / MacOS`.
